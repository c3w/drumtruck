	. truck - uses OSX 'afplay' to quickly preview an entire directory of WAVs
		- additionally, when 
		Usage: truck [save dir] (e.g. truck basshits)
			. prompts to save each sample, while it plays it via afplay in the background (for fast previews)
	. nanopads - builds nanostudio kits from a large WAV directory
		Usage: nanopads [kitname]  (e.g. nanopads korg_)
			. strips spaces from filenames
			. resamples anything that ffmpeg recognizes, to a 44.1k WAV
			. splits out to multiple packages, based on MAX_PADS (nanostudio supports 16 pads per kit)
			. builds nanostudio Package.trg files
			. moves kits to the build/ directory, to use with nanosync (win/osx utility to copy files to the nanostudio iphone app)

Enjoy!
