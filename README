drumTruck v.01

Got thousands of WAVs and want to package them for nanostudio?

drumTruck is a set of BASH helpers to prepare and deploy TRGs for NanoStudio.

`truck` :: preview and save selected samples to a directory
usage: truck [target dircectory] (e.g. truck funked)
-> each sample is hit (background playing) and you hit YES or NO to keep or skip

`nanopads` :: build (multiple) nanostudio TRGs
usage: nanopads [kitname] (e.g. nanopads korg_x5_)
-> strips spaces from filenames
-> resamples anything that ffmpeg recognizes, to a 44.1k WAV
-> splits out to multiple TRGs, based on MAX_PADS (default 16)
-> build nanostudio Package.trg files
-> moves kits to the build/ directory, to use with nanosync
